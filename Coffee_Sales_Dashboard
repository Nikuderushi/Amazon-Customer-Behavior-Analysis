## Features
- **PivotTables and Slicers:** The dashboard leverages Excel's PivotTables and slicers to allow users to filter data based on various criteria such as date ranges and coffee types.
- **Dynamic Updates:** As you interact with the slicers and adjust filters, the displayed data in the PivotTable and corresponding card sections will automatically update to reflect your selections.
- **Visual Summaries:** The dashboard includes visually enhanced "card-like" sections that display calculated KPIs such as total sales, total quantity sold, and more.
